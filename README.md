This project is NOT supported as it was anymore, because author has changed his mind on it. It's STRONGLY recomended to use this project only as an example for your expirience, because it works and does the job, but does it worse then any other tool that was released ever.

**THIS PROJECT WASN'T RELEASED AT ALL**

# CComponents
The set of high-level instruments for C

## Built-in regex specification
The CComponents library includes a lightweight regular expressions realization for simple cases you need it. A regex required by some methods like `StringClassType.match` and `StringClassType.replace` e.g.
If it don't satisfies yours requirements, you just can to replace `src/util/regex.c` file content to what you want. Custom regex realization was written because of some reasons, a few of that described below:
- Windows MinGW doesn't contains `<regex.h>` header unlike UNIX-systems
- Including PCRE2 or other regex realizations will affect on library independence
- Using C++ regex makes to change a project compiler and incompatibility with only-C-oriented compilers

Here a list that describes some things that this custom regex supports:

|  Pattern  | Description                                                                        |

|  `[...]`  | A symbol sequence what recognizes as one unit                                      |
|    `*`    | Indicates **any** amount of unit that described before                             |
|    `+`    | Indicates **one or more** unit amount                                              |
|    `?`    | Indicates **one or zero** unit amount                                              |
|   `\s`    | Space characters: `\r\n\t\f\v `                                                    |
|   `\w`    | Word characters: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789_` |
|   `\d`    | Digit characters: `0123456789`                                                     |
|   `\S`    | **Will available after 0.0.2 release** Non-space characters                        |
|   `\W`    | **Will available after 0.0.2 release** Non-word characters                         |
|   `\D`    | **Will available after 0.0.2 release** Non-digit characters                        |
|    `.`    | Means any character                                                                |
|   `()`    | **Will available after 0.0.2 release** Subexpression as a single unit              |
|  `(\|)`   | **Will available after 0.0.2 release** Logical **or** between subexpressions       |
|  `{0,3}`  | The custom range of unit matches (`{3,}` works too)                                |
